### Brief description

Inspired by the [Light-up Piezo Drum Kit by Yolanda Ma](https://yolanmz.github.io/light-up-piezo-drum/), I want to create a small personalized handpan with Arduino kit and Max patch that allows me to play handpan in different scales. 

#### Background

Handpan (Hang instrument): 

![HANG image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Panart-freies-integrales-hang.jpg)

Figure 1. "Free Integral Hang (2010)"

- percussion instrument played with hands
- created in January 2000 by the tuners of PANArt Hangbau AG
  (Felix Rohner and Sabina Schärer in Bern, Switzerland)
- based on the Caribbean steelpan instrument
- typically has 9 notes in a pentatonic scale
- a Helmholtz resonator

Figure 2. An example of the tuning of HANG.

Some famous handpan music pieces:
1. [Sam Maher - New York Handpa](https://youtu.be/6oremFnbgO0)
2. [Hang Massive - Once Again - 2011 ( hang drum duo )](https://youtu.be/xk3BvNLeNgw)

#### Limitations/downsides

- not very protable (~ 5kg without case; 50-60 cm diameter)
- hard to tune
- fixed scale on a physical instrument
- costly (~$3500 for a 8/9-note Hang)

#### Plan (ideal for practice or before buying a physical one)

- ~20 cm diameter, < 1kg
- never be out-of-tune
- personalized note/scale
- affordable materials

#### Materials

- papers/pop cans/else
- piezoelectric sensors
- arduino kit
- max/msp
- laptop

#### To explore

- handpan tutorials: play the pre-programmed song step-by-step (i.e. note by note), by lighting up the note/notes and proceed when the player hit the note/notes.
- have a metronome as a background for practice
